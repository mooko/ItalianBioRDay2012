It depicts a Case Study produced completely in R taking advantage of the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package for the Literate Programming and various [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) packages for the proper analysis.\r\n\r\nPaolo Sonego has spent the last four years as a bioinformatician analyzing _omics_ data for a company in Trieste, Italy.\r\nHe has been using R for the last 9 years and occasionally blogs about the power of R at [onertipaday.blogspot.com](onertipaday.blogspot.com)\r\n\r\n**License**   \r\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-Share Alike 3.0 License.\r\nTo view a copy of this license, visit [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).","name":"Italian Bio R Day 2012","google":"","tagline":"Reproducible Research in High-Throughput Biology: A Case Study","note":"Don't delete this file!
