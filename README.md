Abstract of talk
===
Reproducible Research in High-Throughput Biology: A Case Study

The talk will present an introduction to Reproducible Research in the Analysis of High-Throughput data for Biology. It will depict a Case Study produced completely in R taking advantage of the knitr package for the Literate Programming and various Bioconductor packages for the proper analysis:
The Analysis and all the details about the packages selected are included in the workflow.Rnw file.

The talk will also show how the markdown package on CRAN can be used to work with other R development environments and workflows for report production.  If time permits, the talk may touch on how knitr can be used with other markup languages including LaTeX and HTML.  

Paolo Sonego has spent the last four years as a bioinformatician analyzing '-omics' data for a company in Trieste, Italy. He is a strong supporter and enthusiast of the R programming language for statistical computing and graphics. He has a blog devoted to his favorite programming language ([onertipaday.blogspot.com](onertipaday.blogspot.com)). Paolo lives with his love Flavia and their cats Tristan and Tosca in Cordenons (PN), Italy.

He has been using R for the last 9 years and occasionally  blogs about the power of R at http://onertipaday.blogspot.com
