Abstract of talk

Reproducible Research in High-Throughput Biology: A Case Study

The talk will present an introduction to Reproducible Research in the Analysis of High-Throughput data for Biology. It will depict a Case Study produced completely in R taking advantage of the knitr package for the Literate Programming and various Bioconductor packages for the proper analysis.

Paolo Sonego has spent the last four years as a bioinformatician analyzing '-omics' data for a company in Trieste, Italy.
He has been using R for the last 9 years and occasionally  blogs about the power of R at [onertipaday.blogspot.com](onertipaday.blogspot.com)
